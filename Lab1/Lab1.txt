Send an event to the pico using the new channel and the original (default) channel. 
 - Do you get the same result on both? Why or why not? 

Yes. They are both channels whose identifiers I know, so I'm able to raise events to them. As long as the channel is open, I can send events and get the same results.



Delete the channel.
Resend the event using the deleted channel. 
 - What happens? Why?

I get an error, because the channel no longer exists. The event won't go through because the channel I'm sending it to isn't there.
{"error":"ECI not found: <channel>"}



- Send the misspelled event ecco/hello to your pico. What do you observe? Why? 
The directives I receive are not the ones which echo/hello sends back. There is no rule that fires on ecco/hello, so no directives are given and nothing happens. 
{"directives":[]}
